        <p>Hello, my name is James</p>

<p>I’m a London-based web development contractor, working mainly with Linux, Python, vim, whiteboards and hopefully as many excellent people as possible.</p>

<p>During my time with web, I’ve worked in a number of different roles focused on development - from the specification and design, to implementation, management and test. A full breakdown is on my StackOverflow Careers profile.</p>

<p>You can contact me about any potential projects by emailing me on hi AT jamescooke DOT info.
